Woke up at 5. Then left at 5:45. We left late for senior sunrise. Walked with sleepover kids and ruiqi + alex to lhs.

All the donuts were gone when we arrived, so we just ate bagels and drank OJ.

After spending like 30 minutes there we went to bball courts and played bball like a bunch of dgens till 8:20.

Jap class was chill. APgov was even more chill, but i felt drowsy af in that class. 

During lunch, I went to library and slept for like 20 minutes. Left at 1:45 for my 2 pm - 6pm work shift.
